echo "I chose fish as the first and main programming language for this project (PetLand Software) as my original Pet Store only had fish, and I grew a strong attachment to them and couldn't sell them (I also didn't have a business license, so this was still not possible) it was a main component of my childhood dream, and I wanted to represent it with a project language file"
